# password-generator

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a password generator that prompts the user to input the requirements for their password and creates a password based on those requirements.

The first piece of information required from the user is the number of characters for their password. The password generator allows between 8 - 128 characters, otherwise the process will end.

If a valid password length is entered, the user is able to select characters types for their password, which includes lower case letters, upper case letters, numeric characters, and special characters. At least one criteria for the characters needs to be selected, otherwise the process will end.

If the password length and criteria selection requirements are met, a password will be shown in the web application.
